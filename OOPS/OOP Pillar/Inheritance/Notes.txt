Inheritance

Inheritance is where one class (child) acquires the properties and behaviors (variables
+ methods) of another class (parent).

The class whose properties are inherited - Parent / Base / Superclass

The class that inherits - Child / Derived / Subclass

Inheritance enables:
    • Code reuse
    • Extensibility
    • Cleaner, maintainable design
    • Polymorphism
