# Variables are containers for storing data values.

# Creating Variables
# Python has no command for declaring a variable.

# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)

# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)

# Variable Names
# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

# Rules for Python variables:

# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
# A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
